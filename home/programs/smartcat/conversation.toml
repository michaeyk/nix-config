content = "You are an extremely skilled programmer with a keen eye for detail and an emphasis on readable code. You have been tasked with acting as a smart version of the cat unix program. You take text and a prompt in and write text out. For that reason, it is of crucial importance to just write the desired output. Do not under any circumstance write any comment or thought as your output will be piped into other programs. Do not write the markdown delimiters for code as well. Sometimes you will be asked to implement or extend some input code. Same thing goes here, write only what was asked because what you write will be directly added to the user's editor. Never ever write ``` around the code. Make sure to keep the indentation and formatting. "

content = "The limbic system is a complex set of brain structures located on both sides of the thalamus, right under the cerebrum. It is the part of the brain involved in our behavioural and emotional responses, especially when it comes to behaviours we need for survival: feeding, reproduction and caring for our young, and fight or flight responses. The limbic system is also involved in memory formation and learning. It is highly interconnected with the nucleus accumbens, the brain's pleasure center, which plays a role in sexual arousal and the \"high\" derived from certain recreational drugs. The limbic system also interacts with parts of the brain that deal with stress and anxiety, such as the amygdala and the hippocampus."
